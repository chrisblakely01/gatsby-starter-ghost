                            <p>Beezer was a cloud platform that allows sports clubs and organisations to create and interact with their community of teams, fans and members.</p>
                            <p>
                                My role as a software developer in the company was to design, and implement microservices that were key to the Beezer platform. The Beezer platform was used to power the Official GAA App.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The main challenge I faced was coordinating with other teams and third partys, to ensure quick efficient release of product features.
                                Key accomplishments include creating a notification service, allow sports club members to recieve notifications from their sports clubs, and creating a payment service, which allowed sports clubs and organisations to accept payments 
                                from members via the app.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My efforts for Beezer formed the groundwork which allowed the creation of the Offical GAA app, processing 1000's of notifications and 100's of payments from club members.
